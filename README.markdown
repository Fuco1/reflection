reflection
==========

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ekmett/reflection.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ekmett/reflecton)

This package provides an implementation of the ideas presented in the paper by Oleg Kiselyov and Chung-Chieh Shan, [Functional Pearl: Implicit Configurations](http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~ccshan/prepose/prepose.pdf).

However, the API has been implemented in a much more efficient manner.
