This package provides an implementation of the ideas presented in the paper

  Oleg Kiselyov and Chung-Chieh Shan, "Functional Pearl: Implicit Configurations"

However, the API has been modified to use @Rank2Types@ and @TypeFamilies@ and the
implementation has been streamlined to improve performance.
